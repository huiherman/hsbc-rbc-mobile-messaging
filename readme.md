# HSBC to RBC Mobile Messaging Campaign

## Overview

This repository highlights the mobile messaging campaign I led as the **Digital Project Lead** at HSBC Canada. The initiative was a critical part of the broader digital communications strategy during HSBCâ€™s acquisition by RBC.

To support over 700,000 customers during this transition, we deployed **multilingual in-app banners**â€”in English, French, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chineseâ€”across HSBC's iOS and Android platforms. The campaign ensured transparency, trust, and engagement at a time of major institutional change.

## My Role

As Digital Project Lead, I was accountable for end-to-end delivery. My key contributions included:

- Leading a cross-functional team spanning content, design, compliance, and IT.
- Managing copywriting, QA, translation validation, and final delivery approvals.
- Ensuring accessibility and brand alignment across all visual and written assets.
- Transitioning the project from a **Waterfall to Scrum model** to enable a scalable business-as-usual (BAU) process.
- Coaching sales and dev teams to self-manage future messaging campaigns through **Jira and Confluence**.

## Mobile Messaging Launch Story 

### Problem

HSBC needed a more agile and effective in-app messaging feature to drive customer communication. The original delivery model lacked speed and scalability, particularly during the RBC acquisition period.

### Action

- **Initiation & Planning**: I created a structured plan with timelines, risks, and resource mapping. I gathered UX, compliance, IT, and business leads to align on objectives and delivery cadence.
- **Execution**: I led the team through rapid sprints, QA pilots, and translation cycles. I also coordinated feedback loops with stakeholders and monitored QA test results in real time.
- **Transition to BAU**: I shifted from Waterfall to Scrum, trained sales leads to raise Jira tickets, and coached IT on independently managing message deployment.
- **Monitoring & Improvement**: Post-launch, I used **Looker** to track real-time metricsâ€”clicks, impressions, and issue logsâ€”to fine-tune the strategy.

### Result

The mobile messaging launch delivered measurable results:
- **2.2x increase in impressions**, reaching over **67 million**
- **7x increase in click-through rates**
- Added new features such as Chinese-language messaging and a direct investing portal
- Supported HSBCâ€™s win for **Best Mobile Banking** and **Best Digital Banking Awards**
