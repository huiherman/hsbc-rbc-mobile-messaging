# HSBC to RBC Mobile Messaging Campaign

## Overview

This repository showcases the mobile messaging campaign I led as the Digital Project Lead at HSBC Canada.
The campaign was part of a large-scale digital communication initiative during HSBC's sale to RBC.
We launched in-app banners in four languages — English, French, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese —
to keep customers informed and engaged during the transition.

## My Role

As the Digital Project Lead, I was responsible for:
- Leading cross-functional collaboration with content, compliance, design, and development teams.
- Planning and executing the end-to-end mobile messaging strategy across iOS and Android apps.
- Managing copywriting, design QA, translation validation, and final delivery approvals.
- Ensuring alignment with accessibility standards and HSBC/RBC brand compliance.
- Driving significant user engagement:
  - 2.2x increase in impressions (67M+ total)
  - 7x increase in clicks

## Purpose

This project demonstrates my ability to lead regulated digital messaging initiatives, handle multilingual execution, and drive measurable results across enterprise platforms.
